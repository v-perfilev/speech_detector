# Real-Time Speech Detection

This app utilizes PyTorch to detect human speech in real-time, distinguishing it from background noise.

For training the model, speech datasets from Mozilla Common Voice and environmental sounds from UrbanSound8K were used.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/v-perfilev/speech_detector.git
```

2. Install the required packages:


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


3. Copy a dataset with speech and environment sound samples to the `../datasets/speech`, `../datasets/noises` and `../datasets/sounds`
   directories respectively.


4. Generate and save tensor dataset by running the `generate_dataset.ipynb` Jupiter Notebook. In this and the following
   step you can set is_spectrum_model for using a spectrum based model. A spectrogram based model will be used
   otherwise.


5. Train the model by running the `model_training.ipynb` Jupiter Notebook.


6. Run the app:

```bash
python app.py
```
